<h2>Changed beyond recognition</h2>
<div class="step-text">
<p>Dany created the following list:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">dragons = ['Rudy', 'Targent', 'Aggie']</code></pre>
<p>and then played with it for a while. She performed some operations on it, so the result looks like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">['Targent', 'Aggie', 'Rudy']</code></pre>
<p>Now Dany is confused and wants to understand what exactly she has done. Help her out! Place the operations in the correct order â€“ the order in which they were used to get <code class="language-python">['Targent', 'Aggie', 'Rudy']</code> from <code class="language-python">['Rudy', 'Targent', 'Aggie']</code>.</p>
